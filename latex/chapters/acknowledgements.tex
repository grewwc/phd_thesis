  Lots of people give me much precious help. First of all, I really appreciate my 
  supervisor Dr. Stephen Chi Yung Ng for his great support, patience and kindness. Prof. Takata 
  also provides me much help in term of pulsars' emission mechanisms and numerical simulations and 
  is really charming. In addition, I thank Ms. Ruby Cho Wing Ng for her invaluable guidance and 
  advice. They give me not only knowledge and techniques but also encouragements. Therefore, I 
  would like to express my most sincere thanks to them.
